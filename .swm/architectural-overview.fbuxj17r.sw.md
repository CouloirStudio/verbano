This is a comprehensive guide to understanding the file structure and architecture of this project. This application uses a client-server architecture, with the frontend built using React and the backend built using Node.js.

# 1\. Client-Side Structure (`client/src/`)

The frontend of this application is developed using React. It's structured with a focus on modularity and reusability of components.

## Components (`components/`)

The components are divided into three categories:

*   **Core (**`core/`**)**: These are components that make up the basic layout of the application, which are used across the entire app. This includes the Header, Layout, and Sidebar components.

*   **Features (**`features/`**)**: These components correspond to individual features of your application such as recording audio, displaying reports, etc.

*   **Shared (**`shared/`**)**: These are reusable components that can be used across different features of the application. Examples include generic Button and Modal components.

## Contexts (`contexts/`)

Contexts are a way of managing and sharing state across different components in the application. They are divided into API interfaces and application-specific contexts:

*   **API (**`api/`**)**: These contexts manage state and side effects related to calling external APIs. For example, `OpenAIContext.tsx` might expose the current status of a text generation request and a function to start a new request.

*   **Application (**`app/`**)**: These contexts manage state that's specific to our application. For example, `SettingsContext.ts` might expose the current user's settings and a function to update them.

## Hooks (`hooks/`)

Hooks in React allow you to handle state and side effects in functional components:

*   **API (**`api/`**)**: These hooks encapsulate logic related to calling external APIs, and often make use of the corresponding API context. For example, `useOpenAI.ts` might expose the current status of a text generation request and a function to start a new request, building on `OpenAIContext.tsx`.

*   **Application (**`app/`**)**: These hooks encapsulate application-specific logic, and often make use of the corresponding application context. For example, `useSettings.ts` might expose the current user's settings and a function to update them, building on `SettingsContext.ts`.

## GraphQL (`graphql/`)

This directory holds all GraphQL mutations and queries that the client uses to interact with the server. This includes `queries.ts` and `mutations.ts`

*   `queries.ts`: This file contains all the GraphQL queries. For instance, `GET_AUDIO` query retrieves a specific audio based on its ID.

*   `mutations.ts`: This file contains all the GraphQL mutations. An example would be `ADD_AUDIO` mutation, which is used to send a new audio recording to the server.

## Styles (`styles/`)

All the style files related to the application live in this directory. This includes global styles as well as component-specific styles:

*   `globalStyles.ts`: Contains global CSS styles that are applicable throughout the application.

*   `Button.module.css`, `Modal.module.css`: These are CSS Modules that define styles for the `Button` and `Modal` components. Similarly, you will find `.module.css` files for each component that requires specific styling.

## Validation (`validation/`)

This directory contains validation schemas for client-side user input:

*   `audioUploadSchema.ts`: This is a validation schema that ensures an audio file is of the expected format (like `.wav` or `.mp3`) and below a certain size limit before it's sent to the server.

*   `userProfileSchema.ts`: Another example could be a validation schema for a user's profile information, which checks that the user's name, email, etc., are all in the proper format.

## Utils (`utils/`)

This directory stores utility functions used across the application:

*   `dateUtils.ts`: This utility file could provide functions for formatting and manipulating dates used in the application.

*   `audioUtils.ts`: This file might contain functions to process audio data, such as converting from one audio format to another.

## Interfaces (`interfaces/`)

This directory contains TypeScript interface definitions used across the client side of the application:

*   `AudioData.ts`: This TypeScript interface could define the shape of an audio data object, including fields like `id`, `data`, `dateRecorded`, etc.

*   `User.ts`: This TypeScript interface would define the data shape for a user object in the application, including fields like `name`, `email`, etc.

# 2\. Server-Side Structure (`server/`)

The server-side code is developed using Node.js.

## Config (`config/`)

This directory houses configurations for the server and external services. Configuration files include `serverConfig.ts`, which sets up the server settings, and `awsConfig.ts` or `openAIConfig.ts` for setting up credentials and specific settings for these services.

## Controllers (`controllers/`)

Controllers handle the logic for responding to HTTP requests. A good example is `audioController.ts`, which manages requests related to audio data (recording, saving, retrieving, etc.), and interacts with corresponding models, services, and external APIs.

## Services (`services/`)

Services contain the application's business logic. For instance, `audioService.ts` handles the logic behind recording, storing, and retrieving audio data. It interfaces with the `Audio` model and potentially with external services (like AWS for storing audio data).

## Middleware (`middleware/`)

Middleware functions process incoming requests before they reach the controllers. A key example is `authenticationMiddleware.ts`, which verifies a JWT from the client to authenticate the user. Another example could be `errorHandlingMiddleware.ts` that centrally manages error handling for the application.

## Models (`models/`)

Models represent the application's data schema and interface with the MongoDB database. For instance, `Audio.ts` defines the schema for audio data in the MongoDB database and provides methods for querying this data.

## GraphQL (`graphql/`)

This directory contains the GraphQL schema and resolvers. `schema.ts` defines the type definitions and `resolvers.ts` manages the operations (queries, mutations) of the server's API. For instance, an `addAudio` mutation in `resolvers.ts` would interact with `audioController.ts` to handle the saving of new audio data.

## Routes (`routes/`)

Routes map incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate controller functions. For instance, `audioRoutes.ts` directs all `/api/audio` endpoint requests to the relevant functions in `audioController.ts`.

## Utils (`utils/`)

Utility functions used across the server-side of the application are found in this directory. For instance, `logger.ts` can be used for application-wide logging and `fileUtils.ts` for handling file-related operations.

## Interfaces (`interfaces/`)

This directory houses TypeScript interface definitions used across the server side of the application. For example, `AudioData.ts` could define the TypeScript type for an audio data object.

## Validation (`validation/`)

This directory contains validation schemas for server-side user input. For instance, `audioValidation.ts` validates audio data from the client to ensure that it conforms to the server's expectations (format, size, etc.).

# 3\. How Components Work Together

When a user interacts with the application, they're interacting with the React components. State inside components is managed using Hooks, and if state needs to be shared across multiple components, it's managed in a Context.

When a component needs to fetch or update data on the server, it uses an API hook, which communicates with the server via a GraphQL query or mutation. The server-side GraphQL resolvers then call into controllers, which use services to perform the required business logic. Controllers then use models to interact with the database, and return data back to the client.

Middleware functions on the server can process incoming requests before they reach the controllers. This can be used to handle things like logging or authentication.

Validation schemas ensure that the data the client sends to the server is in the correct format, providing an additional layer of security.

Utility functions and TypeScript interfaces can be used anywhere in your code to provide common functionality or type definitions.

# **4\. Feature Example: Recording Audio**

Let's walk through how the different parts of our codebase work together to implement the recording feature. We'll start from when the user interacts with the user interface, and follow the path the data takes through our client and server.

1.  **User Interaction**

    *   `components/features/Recorder.tsx`

    *   When the user presses the record button, the `Recorder.tsx` component calls the `startRecording` function exposed by the `useRecorder` hook.

2.  **Hook and Context**

    *   `hooks/app/useRecorder.ts` and `contexts/app/RecorderContext.tsx`

    *   The `startRecording` function modifies state inside the `RecorderContext.tsx` to indicate that a recording is in progress. It also triggers side effects, such as initializing the Web Audio API to start recording audio.

3.  Client-Server Communication

    *   `hooks/api/useKrisp.ts` and `contexts/api/KrispContext.tsx`

    *   When the user presses the stop recording button, `Recorder.tsx` calls the `stopRecording` function from `useRecorder`. This function stops the Web Audio API recording, then sends the recorded audio data to the `useKrisp` hook.

    *   `useKrisp` sends a request to the server to process the audio data using the Krisp API, and sets a loading state in the `KrispContext.tsx`.

4.  Server Processing

    *   `controllers/KrispController.ts` and `services/recordingService.ts`

    *   The server receives the request from the client in the `KrispController.ts` file. This controller uses the `recordingService.ts` to interface with the Krisp API, sending the audio data and receiving the processed audio data in response.

5.  Database Interaction

    *   `models/RecordingModel.ts`

    *   Once the processed audio data is received, `recordingService.ts` uses `RecordingModel.ts` to save the recording data into MongoDB.

6.  Server Response

    *   `routes/audio.ts`

    *   The `KrispController.ts` sends the processed audio data and the database record back to the client as a response to the initial request, which was routed by `audio.ts`.

7.  Client Update

    *   `hooks/api/useKrisp.ts` and `contexts/api/KrispContext.tsx`

    *   Back on the client side, `useKrisp` receives the server's response. It updates the `KrispContext.tsx` to indicate that the Krisp processing is no longer loading, and stores the processed audio data.

8.  User Interface Update

    *   `components/features/Recorder.tsx`

    *   Finally, `Recorder.tsx` re-renders due to the state changes in `RecorderContext.tsx` and `KrispContext.tsx`. It shows the processed audio data to the user, and adds the new recording to the list view.

And that's it! The user can now see and interact with their new recording. From a single button press, data has flowed through components, hooks, contexts, a controller, a service, a model, a route, and back. This is just one example of how different parts of our application work together to deliver a feature.
