To run your local dev environment you will need a few things on your machine. Follow the steps below.

## Installations

*   Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), version `18.16.0`

*   Install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable), version `1.22.19`

*   Install [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) `2023.1.4`

*   Install Git (if you don't already have it on your machine).

## Getting the sources

Clone the repository locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Coulier-Labs/sait-capstone.git
```

## Build

*   Within the repository directory, run `yarn install` to install the project's dependencies.

*   Then, start a local development of the application by running `yarn run` `start`<swm-token data-swm-token=":package.json:6:2:2:`    &quot;start&quot;: &quot;cd client &amp;&amp; next dev&quot;,`"/>.

## Additional Steps

## Run the Tests

To run all the tests, run:

```bash
$ yarn test
```

To run subsets of the tests - you can use `yarn test:<name>`. For example:

```bash
$ yarn test:server
```

## Scripts worth mentioning ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ú®

Format files in a consistent manner using Prettier.

```
$ yarn prettier
```

See `üìÑ package.json` for full list of supported yarn scripts:
